# Disassembly_Sequential-trajectory-planning
'''
This is the data and programs for the paper "Civil aircraft real-time 4D trajectory planning method with high security under congested, stochastic, and dynamic airspace".
Programs are diveded into three files: Simulation1:China aerospace, Simulation2: Guangzhou aerospace and Simulation3: GYA airway point.
The programs are writen in Python style, and the files named 'main.py'/'mainnew.py' are the runfiles for simulation.
